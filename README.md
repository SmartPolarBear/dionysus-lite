## Credits
The development of this project mostly refers to, and sometimes borrows some techniques, designs and codes from the following project:  
- [mit-pdos/xv6-public](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public)  
xv6 inspired me to start the project to build a kernel, with which I got knowledge of operation systems. And some of its shortcomings motivated me to create this project.
