## Project "Dionysus"  
The project "Dionysus" aims at applying theories and practices concerning operation systems to a hybrid kernel in modern C++. In the long run, It aims at creating an effective microkernel with acceptable performance overhead.

### Motivation  

The techniques used and concepts of programming and design of operation system have changed over time. That's why I want to adapt the advanced and exciting ones in a project as an attempt to do further researches in this field.  

### Features and goals  

- Multi-server microkernel approach  
- Asynchronous OS API  
- Written in modern C++  

### Built With  

#### Environment  

The project is initially built with  

- clang/ LLVM 13  
- CMAKE, 3.19 and above.  

on Debian in WSL2.  

**Note: ** Other compilers may be competent, but C++20 support for compiler is required, for C++20 features like `std::span` are massively used.  

#### Third-party  

- [newlib-cygwin](https://sourceware.org/git/gitweb.cgi?p=newlib-cygwin.git)  
- [microsoft/GSL](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL.git)  
- [llvm/llvm-project](https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project)

   Also, have a look at our [FAQs]().  
2. [Start a discussion](https://github.com/SmartPolarBear/project-dionysus/discussions/categories/general)    
   Discussions can be about any topics or ideas related to CLOX.  
3. [Make a feature proposal](https://github.com/SmartPolarBear/project-dionysus/issues)   
   Language features do you want to appear or not to appear in CLOX? For example, you can propose a new grammar making the lox better, or an idea for library features.   

## Credits
The development of this project mostly refers to, and sometimes borrows some techniques, designs and codes from the following project:  
- [mit-pdos/xv6-public](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public)  
xv6 inspired me to start the project to build a kernel, with which I got knowledge of operation systems. And some of its shortcomings motivated me to create this project. 
- [Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix](https://github.com/Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix)    
A series of papers and the book about the development of minix 3 not only let me know about what is microkernel and how it works but also have a deep influence on the goal and development of this project.

- [vsrinivas/fuchsia](https://github.com/vsrinivas/fuchsia)  
Google's new operation system.
