## Project "Dionysus"
The project "Dionysus" aims at applying theories and practices concerning operation systems to a hybrid kernel in modern C++. In the long run, It aims at creating an effective microkernel with acceptable performence overhead.

## Motivation

The techniques used and concepts of programming and design of operation system have changed over time. That's why I want to adapt the advanced and exciting ones in a project as an attempt to do further researches in this field.

## Roadmap

## Technologies
  
- [Guidelines Support Library](https://github.com/microsoft/GSL.git)

- Limited usage of STL

- CMake

- Clang/LLVM


## Features

- Modern C++

- Asynchronous API

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.  

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate. 

## Credits
The project mostly refers to, and sometimes borrows some techniques, designs and codes from the following project:  
- [mit-pdos/xv6-public](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public)  
xv6 inspired me to start the project to build a kernel, with which I got knowledge of operation systems. And some of its shortcomings motivated me to create this project. 
- [Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix](https://github.com/Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix)    
A series of papers and the book about the development of minix 3 not only let me know about what is microkernel and how it works but also have a deep influence on the goal and development of this project.

- [vsrinivas/fuchsia](https://github.com/vsrinivas/fuchsia)  
Google's new operation system.
