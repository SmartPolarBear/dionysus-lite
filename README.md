## Credits
The project mostly refers to, and sometimes borrows some techniques, designs and codes from the following project:  
- [mit-pdos/xv6-public](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public)  
xv6 inspired me to start the project to build a kernel, with which I got knowledge of operation systems. And some of its  weak points motivated me to create another kernel that refers to more advanced practice in this field. 
- [Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix](https://github.com/Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix)
A series of papers and books about the development of minix 3 not only let me know about what is microkernel and how does it work but also have a deep influence on the goal and development of this project
