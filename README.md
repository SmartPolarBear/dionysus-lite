## Project "Dionysus"
The project "Dionysus" aims at apply theories and practices concerning operation systems on a hybrid kernel in modern C++. In the long run, It aims at creating a effective microkernel with acceptable performence overhead.

## Motivation

The techniques used and concepts of programming and design of operation system have changed over time. And I want to adapt the advanced ones in a single project as a good model or reference for the further researches and progress in these fields

## Tech/framework used
<b>Built with</b>
- CMake
- LLVM/Clang toolchian

## Credits
The project mostly refers to, and sometimes borrows some techniques, designs and codes from the following project:  
- [mit-pdos/xv6-public](https://github.com/mit-pdos/xv6-public)  
xv6 inspired me to start the project to build a kernel, with which I got knowledge of operation systems. And some of its  weak points motivated me to create another kernel that refers to more advanced practice in this field. 
- [Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix](https://github.com/Stichting-MINIX-Research-Foundation/minix)
A series of papers and books about the development of minix 3 not only let me know about what is microkernel and how does it work but also have a deep influence on the goal and development of this project
